    <h2>About Me</h2>
    I'm a student, a creative, and a developer.
    I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp 
    to polish my skills in Full Stack Web and Mobile Development.
    I'm adaptable, trainable and I catch on to tasks and objectives really fast. 
    Self motivation is the key and if 
    it doesn't work the 1st time "try it again".
